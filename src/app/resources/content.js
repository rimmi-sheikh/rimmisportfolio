      Welcome to Rimmiâ€™s Rambles: an unfiltered stream of thoughts no one asked for, but here we are.
      Failed projects, weird bugs, and occasional success storiesâ€”if you can call them that.

      Refresh for a new one. Or donâ€™t. Itâ€™s not like the codeâ€™s going anywhere.

      I am an engineering enthusiast with a passion for electrical systems, environmental technology, 
      with a surprising fondness for bridges (made of cardboard, spaghetti, or anything solid really). I merge hardware, AI, and sustainability to create 
      impactful solutionsâ€”from air quality monitoring to flood detection systems. Whether I'm debugging code 
      or building a car chassis from scratch, my work bridges the gap between practicality and ingenuityâ€”
      sometimes literally.
