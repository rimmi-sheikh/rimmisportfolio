      Welcome to Rimmiâ€™s Rambles: an unfiltered stream of thoughts no one asked for, but here we are.
      Failed projects, weird bugs, and occasional success stories - if you can call them that.
      <br />
      Refresh for a new one. Or donâ€™t. Itâ€™s not like the codeâ€™s going anywhere.

    Hi, Iâ€™m Rimmal, an <InlineCode>A Level student</InlineCode> from Lahore, Pakistan who spends too much time debugging <InlineCode>circuits</InlineCode> and pretending my <InlineCode>3D models</InlineCode> have structural integrity.
    <br />I like working with <InlineCode>hardware</InlineCode>, <InlineCode>environmental tech</InlineCode>, and ideas that require five more <InlineCode>sensors</InlineCode> than necessary.
    <br /><InlineCode>Welcome to my portfolio ðŸ‘¾.</InlineCode>
    <br />This is where I keep the projects that survived testing, the ones still in testing, and the ones Iâ€™ll fix eventually.

      I am an engineering enthusiast with a passion for electrical systems, environmental technology, 
      with a surprising fondness for bridges (made of cardboard, spaghetti, or anything solid really). I merge hardware, AI, and sustainability to create 
      impactful solutionsâ€”from air quality monitoring to flood detection systems. Whether I'm debugging code 
      or building a car chassis from scratch, my work bridges the gap between practicality and ingenuityâ€”
      sometimes literally.
