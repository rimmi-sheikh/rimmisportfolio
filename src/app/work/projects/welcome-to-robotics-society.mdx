It began with a clap.

No really—one crisp clap, and the whole thing sprang to life like a dramatic entrance in a sitcom.

A 16-pin LCD lit up with “Welcome to the Robotics Society.”  
An RGB LED strip started flashing like it had something to prove.  
A servo motor, carrying a paper hand I hastily cut out, began to wave (very regally).  
And a passive buzzer launched into a valiant attempt at the *Star Wars* theme.

This was my opening act as the new Robotics Club President. Because nothing says “I’m ready to lead” like making a microcontroller perform a synchronized welcome dance.

## The Build

This was never meant to be a serious technical flex. I just wanted something light, fun, and a little ridiculous to signal the start of a new chapter for our club. It’s a project powered by an **ELEGOO Mega**, triggered by an **acoustic sensor** (so yes, clapping = initiation), and it comes with the theatrical flair of a servo and some RGB mood lighting.

Coding the buzzer to play the *Star Wars* theme from scratch was a mix of “wait this is actually working” and “why do I hear boss music.” It doesn’t get every note right, but the energy is there. The servo? Flawless. The paper hand? Slightly curled at the edges from tape stress, but emotionally committed.

## The Components

- ELEGOO Mega Board  
- 16-pin LCD  
- Passive Buzzer  
- Servo Motor with a paper hand  
- Acoustic Sensor (clap detection supremacy)  
- RGB LED strip  
- Breadboard, jumper wires, tape, and way too much coffee

## Symbolism, Probably

More than just a meme-worthy intro, this little gadget felt like a handshake between me and the club—silly, scrappy, and full of blinking lights. It's not just about what the board does, but *why* it does it. A welcome message coded by someone who’s both excited and mildly sleep-deprived.

Can’t wait to get into this in the next academic year.
