## Accidentally Became the 3D Designer (Again)

When our school team signed up for the NSS Gerard K. O'Neill Space Settlement Contest, we had structure plans, research documents, and presentation decks‚Äîbut no 3D model. Turns out, no one in the group knew Blender. Except me. Kind of.

I had originally learned Blender for the ARSSDC (Asian Regional Space Settlement Design Competition), mostly by watching tutorials and trying to make shapes that didn‚Äôt instantly break the laws of physics. So when NSS came around and we needed another space habitat visualized, I stepped in again.

## Starting Point: A Sketch and a Lot of Guessing

The structural department gave me a basic layout: some rings, a central axis, and general functionality. It wasn‚Äôt a blueprint‚Äîit was more of a ‚Äúhere‚Äôs the idea, can you... make it?‚Äù So I tried.

Over the next 2-3 days, I modeled everything from radiation shielding and solar panels to artificial gravity rings and living quarters. The habitat includes rotational sections for gravity, solar arrays for power, and enough detail to make it look like we knew what we were doing (we mostly did).

## Key Learnings

- Blender is a great tool once you get past the interface-induced panic.
- Even if you‚Äôre not ‚Äúthe‚Äù designer, sometimes you just become the designer.
- Good references (and a lot of patience) can turn a napkin-sketch idea into something pretty decent-looking.
- You can fake confidence by adding lights and shadows strategically.

## Final Result

The render turned out better than I expected, honestly. It wasn‚Äôt perfect, but it looked like a place where people could actually live in orbit. More importantly, it helped bring our team's concept to life‚Äîand gave our submission a visual boost that made it feel real.

I didn‚Äôt plan on modeling space stations, but here we are.
