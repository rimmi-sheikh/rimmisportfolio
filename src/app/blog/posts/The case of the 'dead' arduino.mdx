You know how some days your brain just decides to take a nap mid-conversation? Turns out, Arduinos do that too.

It all began on an otherwise chill afternoon, when I was deep in the trenches of wiring up a new sensor for an Arduino project (as one does when you have zero chill and a to-do list titled “make cool stuff for funsies”).

But then—disaster.

Nothing responded. No lights. No blinking. Not even the comforting little flicker of a board trying to communicate. I poked. I prodded. I double-checked the code, the wiring, the COM port. Nothing. Board. Was. DEAD.  
Or so I thought.

Cue dramatic music and me whispering “no no no no no” like a one-person tech support hotline.

Obviously, I did what any calm and rational person would do: spiraled. And then I very responsibly ordered a new board because clearly, my beloved Arduino had passed on to the silicon afterlife.

Fast forward a few days. New board arrived. Plugged it in. Worked instantly. “Ah yes,” I nodded, “I am valid. I was betrayed.”

But plot twist: I decided to plug in the “dead” board one last time, just for closure. No wires, no sensors—just raw USB.

**AND. IT. WORKED.**

THE THING WAS FINE.

I blinked at it. It blinked back at me. We shared a moment of quiet, blinking betrayal.

### 🧠 What I Learned (other than my tech trust issues):

- Always isolate and test your components individually before declaring them legally deceased.
- Some shorts or component conflicts might quietly lock up your board until you remove all connections.
- And most importantly: never underestimate the power of turning it off and on again, alone.

Anyway, now I have two Arduinos, and trust issues.
